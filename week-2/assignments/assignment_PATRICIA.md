2. Special characters like !, ', * can be added into xml document by character or entity references. If we do not want to use the character or entity references and instead want to use the special characters as it is, we can use CDATA. Character data is not processed, but instead is treated as pure data content.

3. Comment added to `week-2/assignments/assignment.xml`
